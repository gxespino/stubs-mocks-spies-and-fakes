### Stubs, Mocks, Spies and Fakes
(Nothing is real anymore)

---

### TIL:

- Stubs
- Mocks
- Spies
- Fakes
- When, how and why to use either

---

### Background

+++?code=src/background.rb&lang=ruby

+++

```ruby
class Parser
  def self.parse(csv_file)
    ...
  end
end

class Loader
  def self.load!(parsed_data)
    ...
  end
end
```

---

### Stubs

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    processor = Processor.new

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

No stubs in place. Object and it's tests are tightly _coupled_ to it's dependencies

+++

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    parser    = double('parser')
    loader    = double('loader')
    processor = Processor.new(parser: parser, loader: loader)
    allow(parser).to receive(:parse).and_return('PARSED')
    allow(loader).to receive(:load!).and_return(Result.new(:success))

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

Stubs are great for QUERY methods
But they don't suffice for COMMAND methods

+++

```ruby
def process(csv_file)
  begin
    parsed = parser.parse(csv_file)
    loader.load!(parsed)

    Result.new(:success)
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid => invalid
    Result.new(:failed, invalid.record.errors)
  end
end
```

@[1-2, 5-10](Using stubs our test would still pass if we removed these two lines!)

+++

What should we do instead?

---

### Mocks

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    parser    = double('parser')
    loader    = double('loader')
    processor = Processor.new(parser: parser, loader: loader)
    expect(parser).to receive(:parse).and_return('PARSED')
    expect(loader).to receive(:load!).and_return(Result.new(:success))

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

@[3-4](Still using the same Doubles)
@[6-7](A mock is just like a stub, except that it doesn't just allow methods to be invoked; it expects it.)

+++

stubs = allow

mocks = expect

+++

Is Loading into a Database a Command or a Query? How does this affect whether or not we should use a stub vs mock?

+++

Downside: Mocks muddle up our tests by setting expectations out of order

+++

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    parser    = double('parser')
    loader    = double('loader')
    processor = Processor.new(parser: parser, loader: loader)
    expect(parser).to receive(:parse).and_return('PARSED')
    expect(loader).to receive(:load!).and_return(Result.new(:success))

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

### Spies

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    parser    = double('parser')
    loader    = double('loader')
    processor = Processor.new(parser: parser, loader: loader)
    allow(parser).to receive(:parse).and_return('PARSED')
    allow(loader).to receive(:load!).and_return(Result.new(:success))

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(parser).to have_received(:parse).with('test_file.csv')
    expect(loader).to have_received(:load!)
    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

@[9](Act)
@[11-13](Assert)
@[6-7, 11-12](Spy)

+++

Spies are ALSO stubs. They just also have an explicit expectation.

+++

Benefits of Spies:

- Tests are organized clearly in Arrange, Act, Assert <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Easier to understand <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Easier to extract repeated Arrange steps <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Downsides of Spies: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Some duplication (overcome this by extraction) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

+++

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    parser    = stubbed_parser
    loader    = stubbed_loader
    processor = Processor.new(parser: parser, loader: loader)

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(parser).to have_received(:parse).with('test_file.csv')
    expect(loader).to have_received(:load!)
    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end

def stubbed_parser
  parser = double('parser')
  allow(parser).to receive(:parse).and_return('PARSED')
  parser
end

def stubbed_loader
  loader = double('losser')
  allow(loader).to receive(:load!).and_return(Result.new(:success))
  loader
end
```

---

### Fakes

Fake objects that totally replace an external system. e.g. FakeStripe, FakePCS, FakeNewRelic

+++

```ruby
describe DecisionProcess do
  describe '.decide' do
    it 'fetches an account from PCS' do
      account_id = '123'
      allow(PCSClient)
        .to receive(:fetch)
        .with(account_id: account_id)
        .and_return(FakePCSClient.fetch('123'))

      result = DecisionProcess.decide(account_id: account_id)

      expect(result).to eq(:success)
    end
  end
end
```

@[8](Fake client)

+++

You don't need Fakes, you can just stub, spy, or mock everything. 

But, they can be really useful for replacing a large dependency.

+++

Benefits of Fakes:

- Clean solution for a dependency requiring a lot of the same mocks <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Downsides of Fakes: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- A lot of code and maintenance required for when the real object changes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### But wait! There's more!

+++

```ruby
describe '#process' do
  it 'returns a successful Result object' do
    parser = spy('parser')
    loader = spy('loader')
    processor  = Processor.new(parser: parser, loader: loader)

    result = processor.process('test_file.csv')

    expect(parser).to have_received(:parse).with('test_file.csv')
    expect(loader).to have_received(:load!)
    expect(result.successful?).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

@[3-4](#spy method added in RSpec 3.1. Spy automatically stubs all messages for that object)

+++

TLDR:

- Query - return a result and do not alter application state (no side effects) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Command - alters application state (send emails, alter DB, etc.) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

+++

TLDR CONT:

- STUB: if your object under test is calling another objectâ€™s query method. You do not actually care if that query method is called as long as the object under test ultimately does what it should. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- SPY: if you want to ensure that a message was a received by an object. This is necessary when you are calling a command method. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- MOCKS: Eh, lean towards Spies as they don't break Arrange - Act - Assert. Spies used to add some code duplication but this is alleviated with code extraction or the new #spy method. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
